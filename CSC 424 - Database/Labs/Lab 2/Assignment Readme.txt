Construct the following queries in SQL and execute them in MySQL database you have created (The Premiere database). Your output for each query must contain the SQL code and the resulting table. You can copy & paste your SQL code and output table below each query question.   You can submit your lab report in a MS Word or PDF file via Blackboard. I will also look at your work in class (due 9/11).
